# elm-obj-file

A work-in-progress Elm package to decode 3D models from the [OBJ file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). Meshes are returned as [`TriangularMesh`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-triangular-mesh/latest) values, which makes them easy to render with [elm-3d-scene](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/latest) but can also be used with any other 3D graphics system. You could even take the geometric data and use it for 3D printing, physics simulations, [finite element analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) or whatever other crazy thing you want to do =)
